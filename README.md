# Chesters Challenge

Is a simple game to help kids in 1st to 3rd grade learn to program.  

The game is played on a 20 x 20 grid and is a turned based game.  
The challenge is to get as many grapes in the least amount of moves, 
by directing chester using basic commands.

The player must use the available commands on the left to chart a path
to let chester capture as many grapes as he can in the least amount of moves.

Each game will randomly generate grapes and give the player three tries to
let chester capture as many grapes as possible
